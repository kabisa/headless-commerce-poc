## Integrations

Next.js Commerce integrates out-of-the-box with BigCommerce and Shopify. We plan to support all major ecommerce backends.

## Considerations

- `framework/commerce` contains all types, helpers and functions to be used as base to build a new **provider**.
- **Providers** live under `framework`'s root folder and they will extend Next.js Commerce types and functionality (`framework/commerce`).
- We have a **Features API** to ensure feature parity between the UI and the Provider. The UI should update accordingly and no extra code should be bundled. All extra configuration for features will live under `features` in `commerce.config.json` and if needed it can also be accessed programatically.
- Each **provider** should add its corresponding `next.config.js` and `commerce.config.json` adding specific data related to the provider. For example in case of BigCommerce, the images CDN and additional API routes.
- **Providers don't depend on anything that's specific to the application they're used in**. They only depend on `framework/commerce`, on their own framework folder and on some dependencies included in `package.json`

## Configuration

### How to change providers

Open `.env.local` and change the value of `COMMERCE_PROVIDER` to the provider you would like to use, then set the environment variables for that provider (use `.env.template` as the base).

### Features

Every provider defines the features that it supports under `framework/{provider}/commerce.config.json`

#### How to turn Features on and off

> NOTE: The selected provider should support the feature that you are toggling. (This means that you can't turn wishlist on if the provider doesn't support this functionality out the box)

- Open `commerce.config.json`
- You'll see a config file like this:
  ```json
  {
    "features": {
      "wishlist": false
    }
  }
  ```
- Turn wishlist on by setting wishlist to true.
- Run the app and the wishlist functionality should be back on.
